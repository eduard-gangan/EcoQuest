    public const string GARRY_NAME = ">GARRY: My name is Garry, I am local activist. I have been volunteering here for a while trying to improve the situation but with no success.";
    public const string GARRY_BACKSTORY = ">GARRY: In the 1980s, this small fishing village on Sri Lanka’s coast became home to several seafood processing plants, set up to meet the growing global demand. With few waste regulations in place, the factories dumped shells, plastic, and other waste directly onto the beach. As operations expanded, the coastline became cluttered with discarded packaging and debris. Today, abandoned equipment and trash still litter the beach. \nCan you help us clean the beach?";
    public const string GARRY_WHY = ">GARRY: We need someone to help us get the beach clean again. ";
    public const string GARRY_BYE = ">GARRY: Hope to see you soon.";

    public const string LANKA_PLAYER = ">LANKA: *the mayor sighs and crossed his arms while looking at you*  \n>LANKA: Let me be honest, ive seen a lot of “saviors” who came to this town. Activists, scientists, volunteers, each one promising that they would turn this place around and solve the problems. but in then end each one of them left with a very lasting impact. If you can prove to me that you can make a difference I'll repair the Recycling Station.";
    public const string LANKA_STATION_YES = ">LANKA: Congratulations, you have proven your worth to our city, I will start the repairs on the Recycling Station.";

    //Larry(Gary's boyfriend)

    public const string LARRY_GREETING = "The stranger stares quietly at you with a raised eyebrow of uncerstainty… still becomes wary of you as he finds it strange seeing a person approach a run-down building.  ";
    public const string LARRY_NAME = ">LARRY: *suspiciously narrows their eye*\n>LARRY: The name’s Larry, not many people wander here, i used to run this place,\nwell… back when used to be something else… ";
    public const string LARRY_BACKSTORY = ">LARRY: What happened? Well, time and neglect. This place was meant to be the town’s answer to the trash problem, especially with so much waste washing up along the coast. But funding dried up, equipment broke, and no one seemed to care enough to fix it. this place used to be a recycling station, this place used to give life to materials that are seen as wastes... and now its dead.";
    public const string LARRY_PLAYER = ">LARRY: a marine biologist… huh. many people like you came here saying they wanted to ”help”. but they ended up leaving without really finishing what they came here for. Name and title dont mean anything around here if you dont really undestand what is going on. You should find out yourself and prove it with your actions.";

    //Andrew

    public const string ANDREW_GREETING = ">ANDREW: You're one of those scientists, huh? Always coming here, saying you’ll save the ocean.";
    public const string ANDREW_11 = ">ANDREW: You think tracking fish is the answer, huh? The sea’s been good to us for generations, but now... it’s different. Fish are disappearing.\nThere are fewer of the big ones, the ones we rely on. But not all fish are the same. Some of them are special—rare, you could say.";
    public const string ANDREW_12 = ">ANDREW: See, some species of fish, like the Atlantic bluefin tuna or the green sea turtles, are at risk because they only reproduce in certain places, and they don’t produce enough offspring to recover quickly. \nThey’re slow to grow, and they’re targeted by fishing nets because of their high value. Overfishing is pushing them closer to extinction, and once they’re gone, they’re gone for good.";
    public const string ANDREW_21 = ">ANDREW: That’s where your trackers come in. We can tag these endangered species to understand their movements, their breeding patterns, where they like to swim. \nBy tracking them, we can learn more about where they’re going and how they’re surviving. \nThis helps us keep them safe from overfishing. When we know where they are, we can create protected areas,places where no one fishes, so the populations can recover.";
    public const string ANDREW_22 = ">ANDREW: It’s not just about stopping us from fishing. We’ve got to understand the fish better. Some of them like the shark travel across oceans, so it’s not just our waters they need. We need to track them to protect them across their whole journey.";
    public const string ANDREW_23 = ">ANDREW: If we don’t do something, those fish... they won’t be here for the next generation. But with your trackers, maybe we can give them a chance. If we can protect the most vulnerable, the others might have a chance to bounce back.";
    public const string ANDREW_3 = ">ANDREW: If you really want to help, you should go to the Submarine Dock and descend into the Ocean with our Underwater Research Submarine which has the Life Form Analyzer Machine inside.";
    public const string ANDREW_BYE = ">ANDREW: Goodbye, I hope to hear of your deeds.";

Magnificent, isn’t it?\nThe largest living structure on Earth, home to thousands of species.\nIt's been my life's mission to protect places like this, and to see others understand their importance.\nAnd now, here we are, at the end of our journey together."; // Please do this
    public const string CAPTAIN_WHAT = ">CAPTAIN SYLVIA: Well, every journey must end, and I’ve given my life to this mission.\nI’ve sailed these seas, tackled pollution, fought overfishing, and raised awareness for SDG 14.\nBut the world needs people like you who have the knowledge, passion, and drive to continue the work.";
    public const string CAPTAIN_WHY = ">CAPTAIN SYLVIA: Aye, it’s time. I’ve sailed these waters for decades, but now the world needs fresh minds and hearts like yours.\nThis ship, this wheel, it’s yours now.\nYou’ve proven you have what it takes to lead, to educate others, and to protect the oceans.";
    public const string CAPTAIN_TURNOVER = ">CAPTAIN SYLVIA: Yes, you. You’ve earned it. You’ve shown you understand the urgency of reducing marine pollution, preventing overfishing, and conserving habitats.\nYou know how vital it is to inspire others to act.\nI trust you to steer this ship, and this mission, into the future.";
    public const string CAPTAIN_TEST = ">CAPTAIN SYLVIA: That’s all I’ve ever wanted. Remember, the ocean doesn’t need a single hero,it needs many.\nTeach others what you’ve learned. Spread the awareness.\nProtect the life below water, for all life above it depends on it.\nThis is your journey now, Captain.\nMay your compass always guide you true.\nBut lastly i must test you.";
