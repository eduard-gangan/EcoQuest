    public const string GARRY_BACKSTORY = ">GARRY: In the 1980s, this small fishing village on Sri Lanka’s coast became home to several seafood processing plants, set up to meet the growing global demand. With few waste regulations in place, the factories dumped shells, plastic, and other waste directly onto the beach. As operations expanded, the coastline became cluttered with discarded packaging and debris. Today, abandoned equipment and trash still litter the beach. \nCan you help us clean the beach?";

    public const string LANKA_PLAYER = ">LANKA: *the mayor sighs and crossed his arms while looking at you*  \n>LANKA: Let me be honest, ive seen a lot of “saviors” who came to this town. Activists, scientists, volunteers, each one promising that they would turn this place around and solve the problems. but in then end each one of them left with a very lasting impact. If you can prove to me that you can make a difference I'll repair the Recycling Station.";

    public const string LARRY_BACKSTORY = ">LARRY: What happened? Well, time and neglect. This place was meant to be the town’s answer to the trash problem, especially with so much waste washing up along the coast. But funding dried up, equipment broke, and no one seemed to care enough to fix it. this place used to be a recycling station, this place used to give life to materials that are seen as wastes... and now its dead.";
    public const string LARRY_PLAYER = ">LARRY: a marine biologist… huh. many people like you came here saying they wanted to ”help”. but they ended up leaving without really finishing what they came here for. Name and title dont mean anything around here if you dont really undestand what is going on. You should find out yourself and prove it with your actions.";
    public const string LARRY_BYE = "LARRY: farewell, marine biologist. this place needs all the help that it can get, that is if… you are really up for the challenge.";
